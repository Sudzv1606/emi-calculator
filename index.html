                <h3>Understanding Your Loan</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)</strong>: The fixed amount you pay each month to repay your loan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Interest Rate</strong>: The yearly rate charged on your loan, expressed as a percentage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loan Tenure</strong>: The duration over which you will repay the loan, in years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extra Payments</strong>: Additional amounts you can pay to reduce your loan balance faster.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How to Use the Calculator</h3>
                <p>For example, if you have a loan of $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 2 years, with an extra payment of $100 every 6 months, the calculator will show your EMI, a detailed amortization schedule, and a chart of your remaining balance over time.</p>
